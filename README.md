# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Data-Science-ML

## Project description:
In this project I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and outliers removal in a dataset containing house data. Using Scikit-learn algorithms, I built various models and evaluated their performance to determine the model with the highest score to be used for housing price prediction.

## Tools used:
+ Python Pandas, Numpy
+ Matplotlib
+ Jupiter Notebook
+ Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, Lasso, DecisionTreeRegressor,cross validation, train_test_split, GridSearchCV)
